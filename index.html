                <h4 class="about__descriptioncontainer__one">The Bees Knees is a pop rock band originating 
                    from San Francisco, California. The band 
                    consists a dynamic lineup featuring two lead 
                    vocalists, two guitarists, a bassist, a 
                    keyboardist and a drummer. The band achieved 
                    its first commercial success as an unsigned act, 
                    drawing attention from their future manager. 
                    Having extensive experience working with 
                    both new and seasoned acts, the manager was 
                    confident the band could succeed even further 
                    with more support, pushing The Bees Knees to 
                    sign with a well known record label.</h4>
    
                <h4 class="about__descriptioncontainer__two">From there, the band has soared, gaining 
                    international recognition and ranking in the top 
                    10 on the Poster Charts. New fans immediately 
                    fell in love with the band’s original and organic 
                    attitude, solidifying their place as one of the 
                    hottest and fastest up and coming acts of this 
                    century. Fans affectionately refer to themselves 
                    as “The Hive” and are drawn to their candid 
                    and authentic performances on stage. The 
                    Bees Knees are currently recording their 
                    second studio album, looking to be released in 
                    early 2024.</h4>
